                  <div className='Ans'>Sencha partners with regulated cryptocurrency lenders and uses 
                  decentralized finance protocols. With lending, funds are placed on platforms that generate 
                  yield from institutional borrowers........ </div>

              <div className='Ans1'>
              DeFi lending is highly collateralized, often over 125%. This means you have access to your funds 
              at all times, even if a borrower defaults. Sencha is not FDIC insured.

              <div className='Ques2'>What are the risks?</div>
              <div className='Ans2'>
              The DeFi ecosystem relies on the integrity of our partnersâ€™ closely governed and audited smart 
              contracts. There are risks that exist within the platform such as technology, partner risk, and 
              lending risk.
